 This really is perfect as Adobe always works,Positive
"""Although the Adobe Scan app is a wonderful scanning tool with multiple scanning options there are few functions which it lacks & should definitely be incorporated: 1. Folder support unavailable so all scans appear at one place only & you cant really sort out categorically; 2. Each document is uploaded on Adobe server, other than that it does not have other platform cloud support like Google Drive, Dropbox, Onedrive etc.; 3. There is no option of sharing files as jpg or png in case we need it.""",Neutral
sometimes it may consume more time in snchronizing data. Need to add jpg and other basic functions. It would be better if Adobe will create one editing gallery in it. When I preview my scan pdf for the content with some pencil sketch but the pencil drawing is not properly visible after scanning it. Improve the sketch efficiency and take a action on it.,Bug Report
"""Tq, for lates upadte, but still , it didn't ask which format to save, dirctly it is saving as pdf format, after that we addtionally choose as image format. It is draw back. In my openion after scan the copy, it will which format to save. And also flash also not wroking properly while scaning docs.""",Bug Report

"""Can this app scan hindi documents and present hindi document OCR?There is no option of OCR ,but it is presented as OCR too, Its just like normal scanners which I found so far.If OCR is there then developers should give option for OCR""",Neutral

"""I downloaded this App as an alternative to the Chinese Camscanner. Though I find it good, it doesn't seem to completely match up with camscanner for one reason that it doesn't allow me to convert documents to an image format such as .jpg or .jpeg.

"""App is good, but we can take scan each page only, not all togther multiple pages. Camscanner allowed us to create one file for creating scan of multiple pages under one file name, which is not possible i think in this app. Otherwise app is nice , please look into this matter""",Personal Experience
No option of sharing the scanned picture as jpg is given. It should be given because we don't need a PDF most of the time.

The only thing that isn't upto the mark about this app is the conversion of Pictures to the pages of pdf which appear to have been scanned. Appearance of the pictures aren't upto level that the magic colour filter of CamScanner offers. The scanned images in Adobe Scan often have their content blurred or are eliminated altogether,Personal Experience
Images could be saved ONLY in PDF format and not as jpeg. This criteria should be added.,Bug Report

This is a supper dupper app i have ever experienced. So i thought to let you focus on something else. That is we dont have a function to calculate how many number of massages we have sent in one chat box. It's mean think me and my friend are chatting through the whatsapp. So sometimes we want to calculate how many number of massages we both have sent to each other but we dont have a specific function to do that. If you can provide us that capability it will be so exciting. Hope you got my idea.,Feature Suggestion

"When i try to use the draw via AR it just outlines my paper on the edges and then nothing happens. No ""crosses"" appear for me to get started just like in the tutorial. I am already in a well lit room. I was excited to use this app for me to start the beginner lessons but it doesn't work.",Bug Report
It did not put the word next step for me and the line always run so I can not draw at all. And one more it did not put the word paper and it don't give me any step. Please fix this And give it for free please.,Bug Report
I can't draw! because is too many ads and when they appear my drawing will vanish when they apper so i can't continue my drawing ,Bug Report

"Every time when i start to draw, its start to shake, and its not good, it always looses the image. I thought i can finaly draw something really cool, but it just got worse. ",Bug Report
I like this app but it not accurate in papers like if I draw something it go to another page itself even though I didn't finish the first page can u fix it? And make it more accurate on the paper?,Bug Report

"This could be really cool and amazing but like...I can't even do anything really without getting ""buy pro"" shoved down my throat. I was in the middle of drawing and it randomly popped up. The drawings also off but I honestly just blame myself for that. Other then that its a cool and really helpful concept.",Bug Report
Keeps losing the image I am trying to trace. I signed up with PRO thinking it would imorove things but it didn't. I tried this in 4 separate occasions on wall and paper and it doesn't work like demonstrated in the ads. The idea is incredible and I hope they figure out a solution,Bug Report
"Great idea, but keeps bouncing around and stretching at odd angles suddenly. Then it'll time out and you have to go back and re-open the photo cause it wants you to pay for a subscription of course.",Bug Report
Its good but not the best...because if my hand moves a little bit then it say lost tracking...if I add some pictures from the gallery that I wanted to draw there is not that much clarity of the picture came...otherwise it's a good app,Bug Report
